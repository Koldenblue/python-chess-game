# python-chess-game
A chess game programmed in python, by me, Kevin. 

Chess 1.0 uses procedural programming in a single file. See the associated readme in the chess-py-1.0 file for details.

Chess 2.0 uses objects and classes in multiple files. See the associated readme in the chess-py-2.0 file for details.

Descriptions for both programs may go here in the future.
